## Overview

### Deployment: 

http://143.110.235.118/

### Problem: 

UH students often find it difficult to find people to workout with or group fitness activities to join. Many convince their friends to join only to have them bail last minute. Those that enjoy working out with others may just end up not working out. This leads to poor fitness and health.

### Solution:

Our solution to this is the “Fitness Finder” website which helps connect the UH community together and offers opportunities to meet new people and join group activities with other students that would otherwise be hard to find.

### Description

Fitness Finder is a website that UH students can use to find fitness-related activities as well as workout buddies in their area. Whether you are a beginner or a pro, Fitness Finder allows you to broaden your fitness horizons. The main focus of this website is to be able to create a community of students who are interested in furthering their fitness journeys and provide a safe space for them to connect with one another. Starting with creating a profile, users can list their skill level, fitness-related interests, general location,  a picture of themselves, as well as any additional details they might feel the need to include. Once their profile is created, users can create a group for a specific workout session or activity, post to existing groups, or scroll through groups they are interested in. From swimming to roller skating, users have the option of leaving their comfort zone and trying out something new, or honing the skills they already have with others. There is also the option of being matched up with a random workout buddy/group, in the “Random'' tab. Fitness Friends can be used as a networking tool in order to meet people with similar interests that a user hasn’t met before, as well as a way to try new activities that a user may not have thought was available to them. Any important events or workshops will be noted on the calendar.

## Development History

The development process for fitness finder conformed to [Issue Driven Project Management](http://courses.ics.hawaii.edu/ics314f19/modules/project-management/) practices. In a nutshell:

* Development consists of a sequence of Milestones.
* Each Milestone is specified as a set of tasks.
* Each task is described using a GitHub Issue, and is assigned to a single developer to complete.
* Tasks should typically consist of work that can be completed in 2-4 days.
* The work for each task is accomplished with a git branch named "issue-XX", where XX is replaced by the issue number.
* When a task is complete, its corresponding issue is closed and its corresponding git branch is merged into master.
* The state (todo, in progress, complete) of each task for a milestone is managed using a GitHub Project Board.
